/*
Challenge: Create a program that simulates a simple number guessing game.

* The computer will generate a random number between 1 and 50, and the user has to guess the number.
* The program should provide hints to the user, indicating whether the guessed number is too high, too low, or correct.
* The game should continue until the user correctly guesses the number.
* After each guess, the program should also display the number of attempts the user has made.
